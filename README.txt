The set of scripts in this file is intended to show how we perform the analysis and prediction proportion of 
stocked hydroelectric energy (ONS2016) in south of Brazil. The file that should be used for this purpose is 
Application.r, where we perform several analyses: descriptive statistics, fit, Portmanteau test graphs and 
forecast.
Some R packages are required, if you have not installed them just run the following commands:
install.packages("gdata")
install.packages("e1071")
install.packages("forecast").

The other functions required for estimation and testing are contained in the set of files we make available.
Any questions or concerns please contact (vinitscher@gmail.com).
